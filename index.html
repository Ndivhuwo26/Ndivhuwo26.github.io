        <h2>Welcome to The 2D Maze Game Project</h2>
        <p>
          The 2D Maze Game is an interactive project designed to challenge
          players with an engaging maze-solving experience. Built using SDL2 and
          raycasting, the game provides smooth graphics, responsive controls,
          and a fun exploration experience. The goal of the game is to navigate
          through a series of intricate mazes, avoid obstacles, and reach the
          exit as quickly as possible. The project showcases skills in game
          development, rendering techniques, and interactive design, while also
          allowing for future enhancements like new levels and additional
          features.

      <p>
        1. Real-Time Raycasting Engine Description: The game uses a custom-built
        raycasting engine to simulate 3D environments in a 2D space. This gives
        players an immersive experience as they navigate the maze, with walls
        and obstacles appearing realistically. 2 Dynamic Camera Controls Players
        can rotate their view and adjust the camera angle dynamically as they
        explore the maze, adding to the challenge of finding the exit while
        avoiding traps and dead-ends.3Customizable Maze Maps Description: The
        game features editable maze levels where players can modify the map
        layout directly in the code. This allows for unlimited possibilities in
        terms of level design, difficulty, and replayability.

        <h3>Real-Time Raycasting Engine</h3>
        <p>
          The 2D Maze Game leverages a real-time raycasting engine to create a
          pseudo-3D experience in a 2D environment. The raycasting engine
          calculates the distance to walls and objects, allowing for realistic
          depth perception and smooth gameplay. This feature gives players the
          sense of navigating a 3D maze, with the walls and objects rendered
          dynamically as they explore different areas of the map. The engine
          optimizes performance, ensuring that even large mazes can be rendered
          in real-time without lag.

        <h3>Dynamic Camera Controls</h3>
        <p>
          The 2D Maze Game allows players to control the camera angle
          dynamically as they navigate through the maze. This feature lets
          players rotate their view in real-time, providing a full 360-degree
          exploration of the environment. By adjusting the camera, players can
          get a better perspective on the maze layout, anticipate turns, and
          avoid dead-ends or traps. The smooth camera transitions enhance the
          player’s immersion, making it easier to interact with the game world
          and solve the maze.

        />
        <h3>Customizable Maze Maps</h3>
        <p>
          The 2D Maze Game includes fully customizable maze maps, allowing
          players or developers to modify the maze layout directly in the code.
          This feature provides endless possibilities for level design,
          difficulty adjustments, and replayability. By editing an array of
          values representing walls and open spaces, users can create new mazes
          of varying complexity. This customization makes the game adaptable for
          different challenges, whether for casual players or more advanced
          maze-solvers, offering a fresh experience with every playthrough.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        This project, the 2D Maze Game, was inspired by my fascination with
        classic video games and the challenge of creating immersive environments
        with minimal resources. I’ve always been intrigued by how simple
        mechanics like mazes can lead to complex problem-solving and engaging
        user experiences. Developing this project allowed me to dive into the
        intricacies of game development, particularly raycasting and dynamic
        camera control. The journey began during my time at ALX, where this
        project was chosen as part of my Portfolio Project. Over several weeks,
        I explored various game design principles, algorithms, and rendering
        techniques to bring the game to life. This project highlights the skills
        and knowledge I’ve gained, including SDL2 for rendering, real-time
        interaction, and creating flexible, customizable gameplay. As an ALX
        Portfolio Project, this work reflects not only my technical growth but
        also my passion for game development and interactive design. I’m excited
        to continue improving and expanding the game, and I look forward to
        future challenges in the field.
